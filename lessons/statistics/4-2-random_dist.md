[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

### Problem
The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF. What goes wrong? Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

### Solution
The numpy library is already imported in the file, so the first step is to generate 1000 random float values between 0 and 1.

    t = np.random.random(1000)

The PMF can be plotted using the `Pmf` function that the author provides in the thinkplot.py file.

    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
    thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Variable', ylabel='PMF')

A problem occurs when viewing the graph because unlike the graph showing the probabilities associated with birthweights, which ranged from 0 to 16 lbs, this graph plots 1000 numbers between 0 and 1, all with equal probabilities. The lines are very hard to view in the PMF graph and don't illustrate well the equal probability associated with each random value. The CDF is also plotted using the `Cdf` function that the author provides.

    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Variable', ylabel='CDF'

A Cumulative Distribution Function by definition computes the probability that values are less than are equal to the given value. In this example with random numbers, a uniform distribution is expected since all values are equally likely and the CDF in this case is just a percentile. The positive linear slope illustrates that 20% of values are at or below 0.2, 40% of values are at or below 0.4, and so on.
